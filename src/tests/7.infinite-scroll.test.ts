// 7. 7.infinite-scroll.ts
// Problem:
// Implement a simple infinite scroll mechanism for a list of items. The function should take a container element and a callback function as arguments. The callback function should be invoked to load more items when the user scrolls to the bottom of the container.

// 8. 8.promise-all.ts
// Problem:
// Implement a promiseAll function that mimics the behavior of Promise.all. This function should take an array of promises and return a new promise that resolves when all the input promises have resolved, or rejects when any input promise rejects.

// 9. 9.flatten-array.ts
// Problem:
// Write a function that takes a deeply nested array (with arrays as elements) and returns a new array that is a single-level flat version of the input array. The function should work for any level of nesting.

// 10. 10.event-delegation.ts
// Problem:
// Implement a basic event delegation mechanism. Write a function that attaches an event listener to a parent element and handles events from its child elements. The function should allow specifying the event type, the parent element, the selector for the child elements, and the callback function.

// 11. 11.lazy-loading-images.ts
// Problem:
// Implement a simple lazy-loading mechanism for images. The function should load images only when they are about to enter the viewport, improving the performance of the page by deferring the loading of off-screen images.

// 12. 12.css-in-js.ts
// Problem:
// Write a function that allows dynamic generation of CSS styles using JavaScript. The function should accept a style object and return a string of CSS that can be injected into the DOM. This function should handle nesting, media queries, and pseudo-selectors.

// These questions are designed to test a candidate's understanding of JavaScript, performance optimization, and key front-end engineering concepts. They cover a range of topics from basic utilities like throttle and memoize to more advanced topics like event delegation, infinite scroll, and promise handling.
