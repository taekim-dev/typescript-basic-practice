// Problem:
// Write a deepMerge function that takes two objects and recursively merges their properties. 
// If a property is an object in both input objects, 
// the function should merge the two objects. 
// If a property exists in only one object or isn't an object in both, 
// the property should be taken from the object that contains it.
