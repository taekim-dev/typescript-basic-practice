/* Problem:
Implement a debounce function that delays the execution
 of a passed-in function until after a specified wait time
  has passed since the last time the debounce function was invoked. 
  This is commonly used in scenarios like search input 
  where you want to reduce the number of API calls by waiting until the user stops typing. */
